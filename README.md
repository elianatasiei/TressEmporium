## Tress Emporium Beauty Co HairSalon

This is a simple website I created for a hair salon as part of my efforts to improve my skills on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I chose to create a hair salon website because I thought it would be a fun and practical project that would allow me to explore various web design concepts and techniques.

## Why I Decided to Create This Website

As someone who is passionate about web development, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and gain more experience. I felt that creating a hair salon website would be a good way to challenge myself and learn new things. I also wanted to create a website that could potentially be used by a real business, which would give me the opportunity to apply my skills in a practical setting.

## How I Improved My Skills

To create this website, I used a combination of online tutorials, reference materials, and trial and error. I started by sketching out a basic design for the website, which helped me to visualize what I wanted to achieve. I then used HTML to create the basic structure of the website, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality.

Throughout the process, I learned a lot about how to create responsive layouts, use CSS animations and transitions, and write clean and efficient JavaScript code. I also learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage my code, which was an important lesson in version control and collaboration.

## Why Having a Repo Is Important

Having a repository for my code was crucial to the success of this project. Even though I did not keep track of my changes for this project, I understand its importance and how easier it would be to revert back to previous versions if necessary. I also now understand how it would help collaborating with others and getting feedback on my work.

## Future Changes and Updates

Although this website is currently in its early stages, I plan to continue working on it and adding new features over time. Some of the improvements I would like to make include:

Adding more content to the website, such as a gallery of hair styles and information about the salon's services
Improving the website's accessibility and ensuring it meets web standards
Optimizing the website's performance and load times
Making the website mobile-friendly and responsive to different screen sizes

## Conclusion

Overall, I am very happy with the progress I have made on this project and the skills I have developed. This website will 100% serve as a valuable learning experience on my early journey in Web Development. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to reach out!
